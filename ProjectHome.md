## What is GroupMe? ##

#### Why is GroupMe different? ####
GroupMe is a mobile group messaging product.  'Mobile' is where GroupMe sets itself apart.  With an iPhone or Android app, users can create Chats (private chat rooms) and invite their friends.  Any mobile phone user can interact with the Chat through standard SMS (text messaging) if they so choose, or if they don't have a supported app capable device.  Web access is also available.  And now Pidgin is, too!

## What is Pidgin? ##
Pidgin is a chat program which lets you log in to accounts on multiple chat networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on MSN, talking to a friend on Google Talk, and sitting in a Yahoo chat room all at the same time.

Pidgin is available for all major platorms.  You can download it here:
